        <h3>Brief History</h3>
        <p id="tribute-info">

            Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist
            James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The
            band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands
            of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding
            members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist
            Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and
            bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are
            former members of the band.
