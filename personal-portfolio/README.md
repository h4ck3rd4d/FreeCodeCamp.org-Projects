### Outcomes
## ---------------------------------------------------

This project didn't really introduce anything new, but instead was a good culmination project of the lessons prior. I tried to keep the design simple yet interesting. The smaller screens I am most happywith however the 1000px and up could look a little better. Primarily the project grid. I wanted a 2 on top and 1 on bottom center look but couldn't quite get that. Will revisit later.
